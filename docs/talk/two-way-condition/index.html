<p>PHP accepts any type with conditions. Go accepts booleans with conditions, but
not other types. To deal with this, we should simply only use booleans when a
condition is expected.</p>
<h2 id="ternary-operations">Ternary operations</h2>
<p>PHP offers this:</p>

<p>Go does not offer this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason <code>?:</code> is absent from Go is that the language&rsquo;s designers had seen
the operation used too often to create impenetrably complex expressions. The
<code>if-else</code> form, although longer, is unquestionably clearer. A language needs
only one conditional control flow construct.</p>

<p>We can continue to use ternary opeations, as long as the condition is a
boolean. For example with Python or JavaScript.</p>

<p>The first argument is a condition. As such, per the previous decision, it must
be a boolean. For example with JavaScript or PHP. This isnt really useful if we
want to return non boolean values. Further, some languages like PHP coerce the
result to boolean. Or worse, only fail on null:</p>

<p>In order to have two values that can be returned, we would need to use an if
statement or similar. However implementing an if statement means that the
second argument is also a condition, and must be a boolean as well. Better
would be to use boolean type with all arguments. For example with JavaScript.
Further, some languages like Go only accept boolean values:</p>
