# Talk

## Convert to integer

~~~

## Web server

One of these:

## Input output

Keep the Talk page separate from the page of links. One of these:

~~~
content/categories/input-output/talk.md
content/categories/input-output/talk/index.md
~~~

With a category page, the filesystem is ignored, and only pages with that
category are recognized. So all we need to do, is add that category to our Talk
page. We could then put the file itself anywhere we want, but I still like the
current location.
