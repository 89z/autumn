Looking here:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(syntax_extension_for_OCaml)>

I see this:

> Reason offers a syntax familiar to JavaScript programmers, and transpiles to
> OCaml.

However I am having trouble finding instruction on how to transpile Reason to
Ocaml. I look here:

<https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/installation>

but everything seems to be about JavaScript.
